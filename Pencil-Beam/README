Analyze the scattering when charged particles passing through the Atmosphere using Geant4 V11.

1. Simulation space filled in uniform air density
   Change the space size (xWorld, yWorl, zWorld) in construction.cc 

2. Simple detector (TOF) for creating time of flight information
   isTOF = true in construction.cc
   Change the detector size in void MyDetectorConstruction::ConstructTOF() in constructure.cc

3. Set Incident source (type, location, energy) in generator.cc or run.mac files
   add GPS class

4. User defined particle source in generator.cc,and generator.hh

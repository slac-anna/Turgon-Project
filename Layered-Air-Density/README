Simulate cosmic showers using hadronic interactions and layered atmosphere

1. Check the Atmosphere density (h) 

2. Why the following two lines need to commented out? Otherwise, there is segmentaion fault.  
//    if(logicDetector != NULL)
//      logicDetector->SetSensitiveDetector(sensDet);

3. Code crashed using NaI in Scintilation detector

4. Change the space size (xWorld, yWorl, zWorld) in construction.cc

5. Set Incident source (type, location, energy) in generator.cc or run.mac files
